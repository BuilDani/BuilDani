<details><summary>My history Until Now👉</summary>
  I’m Dani, a programmer who’s been through a lot of different paths in tech. I started messing with code early on, and over time I learned how to work with web, mobile, PC, and even game development — from tools like Unity and Godot to low-level stuff like C and electronics.

I’ve always had a thing for creating and fixing things. I’ve repaired motherboards, monitors, and all kinds of hardware, but I also love building software from scratch. It’s a weird but fun mix of hands-on and high-level thinking.

At the same time, I’m a huge nerd at heart. I’m into anime, Japanese language, RPGs, comics, and games like Factorio, Doom, and Darkest Dungeon. I even study Japanese just for fun, and yeah — I’ll argue about that anytime.

Right now, I’m trying to make money doing what I’m good at, even if it’s tough. I’ve worked on chatbots, platforms for businesses, and some crazy ideas that might just work. It’s not easy, but I’m not the type to give up. I believe in building cool stuff and making it useful for people — and maybe having a little fun with it too.
