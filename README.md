<details><summary>My history Until NowðŸ‘‰</summary>
  Iâ€™m Dani, a programmer whoâ€™s been through a lot of different paths in tech. I started messing with code early on, and over time I learned how to work with web, mobile, PC, and even game development â€” from tools like Unity and Godot to low-level stuff like C and electronics.

Iâ€™ve always had a thing for creating and fixing things. Iâ€™ve repaired motherboards, monitors, and all kinds of hardware, but I also love building software from scratch. Itâ€™s a weird but fun mix of hands-on and high-level thinking.

At the same time, Iâ€™m a huge nerd at heart. Iâ€™m into anime, Japanese language, RPGs, comics, and games like Factorio, Doom, and Darkest Dungeon. I even study Japanese just for fun, and yeah â€” Iâ€™ll argue about that anytime.

Right now, Iâ€™m trying to make money doing what Iâ€™m good at, even if itâ€™s tough. Iâ€™ve worked on chatbots, platforms for businesses, and some crazy ideas that might just work. Itâ€™s not easy, but Iâ€™m not the type to give up. I believe in building cool stuff and making it useful for people â€” and maybe having a little fun with it too.
